Module 10 Challenge

## File Usage:

- Part 1 of the assignment can be found at SurfsUp/climate.ipynb
- Part 2 of the assignment can be found at SurfsUp/app.py

#### Note:
Running app.py has given me and a few other fellow students issues on VSCode. If your IDE is also giving you issues running app.py, please run `python app.py` in your terminal/command prompt instead.
